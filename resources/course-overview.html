            <hr>
            <h2>Outcomes</h2>
            <p>By the end of the semester, each student will:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Be an effective communicator, team member, and leader (20%)</li>
                <li>Be proactive, able to operate in poorly defined or constrained situations (35%)</li>
                <li>Know how to create, coordinate, execute, and evaluate a project plan (20%)</li>
                <li>Be able to list and define the core principles of project management, identify and implement
                    multiple methodologies, and explain how they can be used to make a project successful (15%)</li>
                <li>Be self-regulated, life-long learners (10%)</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Course Description</h2>
            <p>This course introduces concepts, issues, approaches, tools, techniques, and technologies applicable to
                the management of projects. Projects can be defined as any temporary endeavor undertaken to create
                unique product, service, or result. The course explores how a manager can plan, organize, implement and
                control non-routine activities to achieve cost, schedule and performance objectives.</p>

            <p>Read carefully the outcomes above. Notice that #2 is ranked higher than any of the other outcomes. This
                course is designed to help students become more proactive...to learn to "Act and not be acted upon" It
                is important to keep this goal in mind when approaching this course. Make sure to remind the students
                of this outcome often.</p>
            <h2>Three Paths introduced</h2>
            <p>This course is structured to allow students three different paths of completion. We will label these
                paths as 'A', 'B', and 'C'. They will decide which path they would like to pursue by the end of Week 2.
                Your focus during this time will be to help them to decide which path is best for them. </p>
            <p>All projects will have a required mid-project and end of project report that students must complete. The
                mid report should happen no later than Week 6, the final report no later than Week 12.</p>
            <p>Make sure that the students understand that they may complete more than one project over the course of
                the
                semester should they choose. Completing many small to medium complexity projects can often be more
                valuable
                than one large project.</p>
            <h3>Path A</h3>
            <p>Path A allows the student the most flexibility and the most opportunity to show that they can take
                initiative and organize and plan a good project. The deliverables, milestones, and grading are owned by
                the students. Students working on plan A should do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Develop a project idea accompanied with a plan modeled off of things
                    that they have researched and studied about project management best practices.</li>
                <li>Complete the proposed project as a group. This does not necessarily have to be groups within the
                    class.</li>
                <li>Develop and follow a project communication strategy.</li>
                <li>Develop an assessment plan.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The Maximum grade for a Plan A student is 100%</strong></p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Path B</h3>
            <p>Path B allows for students to still gain experience in becoming more proactive, but with more
                scaffolding to help them get started. They are given a project charter and plan template to base the
                planning of their selected project around. These projects can be completed as a group or individually.
                Students may modify the provided template provided they support their changes with their rationale.
                The students must produce at least the following artifacts:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Project Charter</strong>: </li>
                <li><strong>Project Management Plan</strong>: </li>
                <li><strong>Schedule Management Plan</strong>: </li>
                <li><strong>Quality Management Plan</strong>: </li>
                <li><strong>Risk Management plan</strong>: </li>
                <li><strong>Communications Plan</strong>: (if done as a group)</li>
                <li><strong>Scope Management Plan</strong>: (if done as a group) </li>
                <li><strong>Human Resources Management Plan</strong>: (if done as a group)</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>If done individually a Plan B student can get a maximum of 85%. If done as a group the maximum
                    grade is 95%</strong></p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Path C</h3>
            <p>Not all students are prepared to become more proactive. Plan C provides a pre-built project with charter
                and Project Managment Plan. The project which the students will complete is to prepare to pass the PMI
                PMP exam.
                <p><strong>Because this plan does not require students to grow in the areas of outcomes one and two,
                        the maximum grade a Plan C student can achieve is 80%.</strong> </p>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Changing Plans</h3>
            <p>A important thing to note and mention to the students: they can switch plans! If a student begins Plan C
                for example...but then takes the initiative to organize a group of other Plan C students to coordinate
                and work together towards a common goal they are showing progress on outcomes one and two...this would
                qualify them for a higher plan.</p>
            <p>Changing plans should be discussed with the professor. Either the student or instructor can initiate
                this conversation. These conversations should take place and be finalized before midterm.</p>

            <h2>Time Consumption</h2>
            <p>The first three weeks of the semester will be the heaviest for the instructor. You will need to help the
                students choose a plan (A, B, or C), project(s), and help advise them on putting their charters and
                PMPs
                together. You
                should be very active in the discussions and as available as you can be. After week three the required
                load on the instructor can drop significantly.</p>
            <p>Week 4 will require time spent grading the charters and PMPs.</p>
            <p>Weeks 5-11 your time will be spent shadowing student projects
                watching for opportunities to advise. You should also prepare a 'Tales from the trenches' presentation
                that can be given either live at a scheduled time, or recorded and posted. These will usually include
                some story about project management that you think will be useful for the students. It is recommended
                to save these as you prepare them for re-use in future semesters. Consider issues that you have seen in
                the previous week when considering the story to share. Try and match the message with the needs
                whenever possible.</p>
            <p>Weeks 12-14 will be when all the wrap up will be happening. By week 12 each project should submit a
                project closure report, and by week 13 students should complete "post-mortem" evaluations of a certain
                number of other projects. It is expected that most of your time will be spent in grading during these
                weeks.</p>

            <h2>Tracking Student Projects</h2>
            <p>After the first three weeks most of the instructor time should be spent each group should present a
                communication plan (which does not
                have to include the official channels). Tracking which students are one what projects, how they are
                planning on communicating with you and each other, and how they will be assessed will require a high
                level of organization on your part.</p>

            <h2>Project evaluations and Post mortems</h2>
            <p>Students are required to give projects that they are not a part of feedback throughout the semester.
                They will be asked to do a bit of research on post-mortem reports and post templates to a class
                discussion board. They can then choose from this list when formulating their feedback.
                This feedback can be given at a project mid-point (based on the mid report) or at the end (post mortem,
                based off of final report). This assignment will be introduced in Week 6 and evaluations can be
                completed anytime between week 6 and week 13. You should
                encourage the students to start on these early.</p>
            <p>The number of evaluations each student will complete will depend on how many projects they have
                completed. The total number of projects + evaluations for each student should equal at least 7. As the
                instructor feel free to raise or lower this number based on the amount and quality of the projects
                being pursued by the class that semester. You could use the formula (Total Projects / total students)
                for
                example to make sure to get good coverage of evaluations. At least one of the evaluations should be a
                true post-mortem...it should happen at the end of a project.</p>
