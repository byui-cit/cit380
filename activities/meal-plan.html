        <h1>Planning a Meal</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          If you have spent any time cooking for a large group, or preparing
          anything more complex than soup or sandwiches, you know that there is
          a lot of preparation that must be done and a lot of details to track
          for the meal to be a success. Planning and preparing a complex meal
          really is a very nice example of Project Management.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this activity you will choose a project management method and then
          plan a complex meal using it.
        </p>

              â€“ You can add your own to this list if you do not see it here). Do
              some research and reading on the method, and then describe it in
              your own words.

            <h3>Plan a Meal</h3>
            <p>
              Apply your understanding by describing how you would use your
              selected method to organize, prepare, deliver, and clean up a
              balanced meal for 3 or more people. Balanced means multiple food
              groups are represented, ie meat or other protein, vegetables,
              fruit, possibly grains or dairy, and an optional dessert. Review
              the following "charter" for more details.

              <p>Dear friend,</p>
              <p>
                Welcome to the neighborhood dinner club. We are excited to have
                you join. There is just one last requirement that must be met:
                we need to assess your ability to plan and execute a dinner
                party. In order to show this you need to prepare and serve a
                meal to the managing board members. If you meal meets our
                expectations...you are in!
              </p>
              <p>Here are a few details you will need:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  You will host us at your place. Let us know what time we
                  should arrive. We will expect the meal to be served promptly
                  after our arrival. You should plan on at least three guests,
                  but can invite more if you would like. You may server the meal
                  indoors or outdoors.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The menu should be for a balanced meal and should be prepared
                  mostly from basic ingredients...if you serve us Ramen or
                  Macaroni and Cheese it had better be home made and delicious!
                  It should involve some sort of protein, and good helpings of
                  fruits and vegetables. Dessert is a must! Drinks are optional,
                  but non-alcholic only please!
                </li>
                <li>
                  Flexibility is important when hosting a dinner party. Bonus
                  points will be given if consideration has been given to
                  adaptation. Sometimes you get late cancels, someone brings an
                  unexpected guest, or has dietary restrictions they did not
                  inform you of (did you ask?)...How will you accommodate these
                  changes and make sure you have enough food?
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                You will need to consider the following as the lead on this:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Consider each phase of the meal: planning, shopping, inviting,
                  preparation (cooking and setup), eating, and cleanup. Make
                  sure you allow enough time for each phase. Did you consider
                  the preparation of each part of the meal you may be making to
                  ensure they are all ready at the same time? Part of hosting is
                  focussing your attention on your guests once they arrive. Will
                  your plan allow you to do this?
                </li>
                <li>
                  The meal does not have to be gourmet or expensive. It should
                  be prepared mostly from scratch however. Keep it simple. Make
                  sure that it fits into your budget. Estimate the costs for the
                  meal once you have decided on the menu.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Who will be helping you pull this off? What will be their
                  roles?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How will you keep me and everyone else involved up to date on
                  your progress and what they should be aware of? How will you
                  extend your invitations and allow for RSVPs from each invitee?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How will you keep track of your progress so you know if you
                  are on track to succeed?
                </li>
                <li>
                  What risks will you face? What could derail your plans and
                  cause the dinner to fail? How will you mitigate those risks?
                </li>

                <li>
                  You should have a detailed plan to me no later than then
                  second week in the semester containing the information above.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                I look forward to eating with you!

            <h3>Execute your plan</h3>
            <p>
              Once you have your plan made...execute it! You should follow the
              plan to actually invite 3+ people to dinner, prepare the meal for
              them, and then clean it up.
            </p>

            <h3>Post Mortem</h3>
            <p>
              At the end of a project it is useful to talk about how things
              went...what went well, what could have been improved, did you stay
              on budget both with time and money? What was your stress level at
              each phase? What could be done to reduce the stress on you at each
              point? This is often called a 'Post Mortem'. Evaluate your project
              and write up your own Post mortem. You might even consider getting
              your guests input on this as well.
            </p>
