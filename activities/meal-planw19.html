        <h1>Planning a Meal</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          If you have spent any time cooking for a large group, or preparing
          anything more complex than soup or sandwiches, you know that there is
          a lot of preparation that must be done and a lot of details to track
          for the meal to be a success. Planning and preparing a complex meal
          really is a very nice example of Project Management.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this activity you will choose a project management method and then
          plan a complex meal using it.
        </p>

              <p>Dear child,</p>
              <p>
                You know that you have always been my favorite, and now I'm
                giving you the chance to prove it! As you are aware it is our
                turn this year to host the Family Thanksgiving Feast. We haven't
                had this opportunity for many years and, as you may remember,
                last time it was a disaster! I might be dead by the time this
                opportunity comes around again, and your job is to make sure you
                make this the best Thanksgiving EVER!
              </p>
              <p>Here are a few details you will need:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  We need to locate and secure a great venue to host. Should be
                  able to accommodate up to 40 people. We must leave this venue
                  clean at the end of the event or they will charge us extra...I
                  do not want to pay extra.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The meal must be planned and executed to perfection. The first
                  course ready when the guests arrive, with each additional
                  course prepared and presented in order. No cold mashed
                  potatoes!
                </li>
                <li>
                  You should plan on at least 5 courses. You have some
                  flexibility on what will be served in each of those
                  courses...just don't embarrass me!
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                You will have the following responsibilities as the lead on
                this:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Staffing: Make sure you arrange to have enough cooks and
                  servers. These can be recruited from the family. But you
                  should let me know your plan for inviting and coordinating
                  with them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Budget: Make sure to let me know how much the event will cost.
                  You will have at least a venue to rent and food to purchase
                  and prepare.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Communications: how will you keep me and everyone else
                  involved up to date on your progress and what they should be
                  aware of?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Tracking: how will you keep track of your progress so you know
                  if you are on track to succeed and so that you know what to
                  tell me when I want updates?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Risks: what risks will you face? What could derail your plans
                  and cause the dinner to fail? How will you mitigate those
                  risks?
                </li>

                <li>
                  Planning: you should have a detailed plan to me no later than
                  then second week in November containing the information above.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                I have the utmost confidence in you, but know that if you fail
                you will no longer be my favorite and I may never speak to you
                again!
              </p>
              <p>Your loving Mother</p>
